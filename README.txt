A program which lets you keep track of orders of certain items. 
This is one of my first programs so the code may be disorganized.

This program allows the user to track fictional orders (initially of certain computer parts, this can
be changed in the code). Each order in this program has a product, a buyer and an amount. The product 
is what is being ordered, the buyer is the person who is buying it (fictional), and the amount is the
amount of the product being ordered.

The user can:
	- Add orders specifying the product, amount, and buyer
	- See all orders stored on the system
	- See the total amount of items from all orders
	- Remove all the orders which include a certain product
	- Remove all the orders made by a certain buyer
	- Remove specific orders
